## Initial Feedback 

### Project idea
As an eater, I am always curious about new restaurants so I'm very curious. There is no shortage of directions you could take such a project once you built up a critical mass of users.

### Scope of work
I get a general sense of your project but don't see the details very clearly. The wireframes help, but I feel like I'm missing part of it. I feel like the parts are here but could use some structuring. Let's have a discussion about it.

### Docs
The start on your docs looks good. For your benefit, keep those up-to date as you make decisions and refine your designs. Use your `integrations.md` file to keep track of any useful information that you find about setting-up and configuring the integrations. These can be a pain to figure out sometimes, document it so it is easy for your other team members and for you later when you forget... If you all use these docs as THE place that you put any and all documentation about your project, it will be easier for you all to stay on the same page.
